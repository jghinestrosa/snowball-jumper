# Snowball Jumper

## Story

This game was born as a way to spend two days of my Christmas holidays. I came up with the idea of a winter or Christmas related game applying some rules to the development process:

- Don't spend more than two days in the development
- Don't use any game framework
- Paint my own sprites and background
- Pixels everywhere

To sum up, I wanted to make a game just for fun as my last project of the year 2017.

Due to the two days limitation there are some code decissions I'm not proud of but I decided to keep that way simply because it works.

This is the result of that idea, a winter game that reflects a certain moment of the end of 2017 to me.

Probably I will add some improvements and refactor in my spare time from here on.
